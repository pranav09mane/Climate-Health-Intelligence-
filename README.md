# 🌍 Climate Health Intelligence

## 📌 Project Overview
**Climate Health Intelligence** is a data-driven project designed to analyze the relationship between **climate factors** and **health outcomes** across cities in the USA.  
By combining data science techniques with an interactive web interface, the project makes complex datasets easier to understand through clear visualizations and insights.

## ❓ Problem Statement
Climate change directly impacts public health, yet raw climate and health datasets are often difficult to interpret.  
This project bridges the gap by:  
- Cleaning and preprocessing climate–health datasets  
- Extracting meaningful relationships between air quality, temperature, and respiratory health  
- Presenting insights through a professional and interactive dashboard  

## ✅ Solution
The project integrates both **data science workflows** and **UI/UX design** to deliver an accessible analytical tool:  

1. **Data Science**  
   - Data preprocessing and cleaning  
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
   - Visualizations for climate and health correlation  
   - Predictive modeling (where applicable)  

2. **Web Interface**  
   - Dashboard to display insights  
   - Interactive charts and graphs for end-users  
   - Easy-to-navigate structure with professional styling  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS  
- **Python Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly  
- **Frameworks/Tools**: Streamlit (for ML pipeline), Vanilla JS (for dashboard logic)  

## 📊 Features
- Climate and health dataset integration  
- Data cleaning and transformation pipeline  
- Visual insights through scatter plots, charts, and dashboards  
- User-friendly dashboard (index.html) to explore results  

🌟 Key Insights
1. Relationship between air quality (AQI) and respiratory health issues
2. Visualization of climate factors across cities
3. Clear and structured presentation of processed data
